So Long

This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

## Bonus

- Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
- Add some sprite animation.
- Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.
